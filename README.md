### BabyEcho is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the React Native framework, a cross-platform mobile development framework, allowing us to develop the app for both iOS and Android from a single codebase. For state management, the app utilizes Redux, providing a predictable state container for managing application state, including user sessions, baby monitoring data, and notifications.

- For persistent storage, the app uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database that efficiently manages baby data, cry analysis sessions, and progress tracking. Cry pattern analysis is powered by FastAPI, a modern Python-based web framework that integrates machine learning models to assess and provide real-time feedback on the baby's cry.

- ðŸš¨ Node.js and Express.js are used to manage backend functionalities, including user authentication, session tracking, and interactions with AI models for cry pattern analysis. The app integrates with IoT devices (ESP8266) for real-time monitoring and control, enhancing baby monitoring capabilities.

- User audio files and other assets are securely stored in AWS S3, ensuring scalable and reliable file storage for the application.
